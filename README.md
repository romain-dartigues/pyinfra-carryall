# Pyinfra — tips and tricks

This repository is a carryall with one branch per situation (so check each branch carefully!).

The code is dual-licenced under the BSD 3-Clause License and the [WTFPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/wtfpl/).

It has been dumped in this carryall/totebag repository in hope to be useful to others.
You are welcome to use it, create a public project, I'll even be happy to be a contributor, but I don't have the energy right now to publish them as proper packages.
